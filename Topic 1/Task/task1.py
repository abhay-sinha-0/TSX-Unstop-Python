1. Install Python 3 on Your Computer
Windows/macOS/Linux:
Go to the official site: https://www.python.org/downloads/
Download and install the latest version of Python 3.
✔️ Make sure to check the box “Add Python to PATH” during installation (on Windows).

2. Install a Code Editor
You can choose from:

VS Code (Recommended): https://code.visualstudio.com/

PyCharm: https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/

Sublime Text or Atom if you prefer lightweight editors.

3. Write a Simple Python Script
Create a new file named greeting.py, and paste the following code:

print("Hello, my name is Abhay Kumar. Nice to meet you!")
Save the file, and run it using your terminal or editor.

To run it via terminal/command prompt:


python greeting.py
4. Experiment with Running Python Code in the Interpreter
Open the terminal or command prompt, type python or python3, then hit Enter.
You should see the interactive Python shell (>>>) like this:


>>> print("Hi from the interpreter!")
Hi from the interpreter!
>>> 3 + 5
8
>>> name = "Abhay"
>>> print("Hello " + name)
Hello Abhay
Exit with exit() or Ctrl + Z (Windows) / Ctrl + D (Mac/Linux).


5. Script With Comments Explaining Each Part
Here's a sample script with comments:

# This script prints a greeting and does a simple calculation

# Printing a greeting message
print("Hello, my name is Abhay Kumar!")

# Storing a number in a variable
num1 = 10

# Storing another number
num2 = 20

# Adding the numbers and storing the result
sum_result = num1 + num2

# Printing the result
print("The sum of", num1, "and", num2, "is", sum_result)
